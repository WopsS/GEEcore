# What is GEEcore?

GEEcore, short for **G**ame **E**ngine **E**xtender core, is a versatile library
designed to streamline the process of developing script extenders for various
video games. This essential tool provides a set of core utilities and
functionalities that significantly simplify the creation of game extensions,
making it easier for developers to enhance and expand the capabilities of their
favorite games.

## Purpose of GEEcore

### 1. Extending Game Functionality

Video game enthusiasts often seek to modify or extend the functionality of their
favorite games to enhance gameplay, add new features, or fix bugs. However,
creating these modifications, commonly referred to as script extenders, can be a
complex and time-consuming process. GEEcore aims to simplify this task by
providing a solid foundation of core utilities and functions that developers can
build upon.

### 2. Cross-Game Compatibility

Different games employ various game engines and programming languages, making it
challenging for modders to create extensions that work across multiple titles.
GEEcore addresses this issue by offering a consistent framework that can be
adapted to different game engines and environments. This cross-game
compatibility makes it easier for developers to create extensions that can be
utilized across a range of games.

### 3. Reducing Development Time

Developing a script extender from scratch can be an arduous undertaking.
GEEcore's pre-built functionalities and libraries significantly reduce the time
and effort required to create a functional extender. This allows developers to
focus more on implementing the unique features and improvements they envision
for their game modifications.
